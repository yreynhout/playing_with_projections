(* HERE YOU START 
1- You can use the two following functions to load stream in memory
   - fetchStream to fetch it directly from the Web
   - readStream to read from JSON file on disk (in case on wifi loss...) 
2- Pipe to parseEvents to get a stream of typed events.
3- You can add any event really easily with 2 lines:
   - add a type with a JsonProvider where you give an example of JSON (taken from the stream) => it builds a parser type
   - add an union case for this event in Events type using [JsonProvider type].Root type *)

// SAMPLE: parse of stream 0
let stream0 = fetchStream "0" |> parseEvents
stream0 |> printfn "%A"
